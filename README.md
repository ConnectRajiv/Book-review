# Book-Review-App
A RESTful API built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, allowing users to manage books and post reviews. Authenticated users can add books, post reviews, and manage their own content. This project demonstrates secure backend development, clean modular code, and well-designed API architecture.

## Features
- User Signup & Login (JWT-based authentication)
- Add and View Books with pagination, filtering, and search
- Post one review per book per user
- Update or delete your own reviews
- Search books by title or author (partial & case-insensitive)
- Modular project structure for scalability

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Environment Config: dotenv
- Pagination & Filtering: Built-in query options

  password: String
}
```

##  Database Schema Design

 **Key Entities:**
- **User:** Stores user credentials and basic details.
- **Book:** Contains book information like title, author, and genre.
- **Review:** Connects a user and a book through a one-to-one relationship per book, with a rating and comment.

| `title`    | String    | Title of the book       |
| `author`   | String    | Author's name           |

###  ER Diagram

The following diagram represents the core entities and their relationships in the Book Review API system.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User {
        ObjectId _id PK
        String name
        String email
        String password
    }
    
    Book {
        ObjectId _id PK
        String title
        String author
        String genre
    }
    
    Review {
        ObjectId _id PK
        ObjectId user FK
        ObjectId book FK
        Number rating
        String comment
    }
    
    User ||--o{ Review : "writes"
    Book ||--o{ Review : "has"
```

 ###  Relationships
 - A User can write many Reviews, but only one review per Book.
 - A Book can have many Reviews.
 - Each Review belongs to one User and one Book.
   
##  Design Decisions & Assumptions
### Design Decisions
- **Modular Structure**: Separated controllers (handle requests) and services (handle logic) for cleaner code.
- **JWT Authentication**: Protected routes require JWT in the Authorization header.
- **One Review per Book per User**: Enforced to maintain review uniqueness.
- **Pagination**: Default limit = 10 in book and review listings.
- **Search**: Case-insensitive partial match for title and author using regex.
- **Protected Routes**: Only logged-in users can add books or reviews.

###  Assumptions
- All users are treated equally (no roles like admin).
- Users can update or delete only their own reviews.
- Basic validation is handled via Mongoose.
- No advanced features like likes, replies, or media for now.
